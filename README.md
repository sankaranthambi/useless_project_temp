### Project Description
Gamble Calculator turns boring math into a chaotic gacha adventure ‚Äî you enter numbers you want to calculate, spin a fiery roulette of fate, and pray to the gods for a correct answer. Cheat codes (like Ashik,Manu etc) summon power-up banners, boost (or curse) your luck, and every spin comes with over-the-top reactions worthy of a legendary pull.
Have something to calculate ? u better be lucky.
cheat codes : ashik,manu,aibel,nirenjan,adithyan,sreenath,aswin

### The Problem 
Math is too reliable ‚Äî calculators always give correct answers

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Replace boring, accurate calculators with Gamble Calculathor ‚Äî a gacha-fueled math machine where every calculation is decided by a flaming probability spinner, cheat codes, and pure luck, ensuring that even simple math feels like rolling for a 5-star hero.
